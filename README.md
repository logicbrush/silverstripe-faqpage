# silverstripe-faqpage

A module for the SilverStripe CMS which allows you to present a searchable list
of frequently asked questions.

## Why?

We needed a simple way to present a set of searchable list of question/answer
pairs.

## Installation

```sh
composer require "logicbrush/silverstripe-faqpage"
```

## Usage

Install the module and you'll have a new page type of "FAQ Page".  You can
add child "Question" pages and manage them independently.
